## COVID-19 data extracted from BMC's COVID-19 Response War Room Dashboard


BMC publishes daily updates in the form of 40 pages of tables, graphs and maps detailing various aspects of the COVID-19 situation in Mumbai [here](https://stopcoronavirus.mcgm.gov.in/key-updates-trends). One of the earliest references to this dashboard's availability is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AshwiniBhide/status/1268604886930857985). 

As the official portal only allowed access to the most recent report, we have archived past reports from June 13, 2020 and extracted data to create a time-series dataset of cases, containment, health infrastructure, etc.

### This list contains the datasets extracted and published so far and will be updated as new datasets are added.
